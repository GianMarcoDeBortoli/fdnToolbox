# fdnToolbox
Matlab Toolbox for Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs). This is a pre-release version. An accompanying paper is in preparation. 

Feedback delay networks (FDNs) are recursive filters, which are widely used for artificial reverberation and decorrelation. This toolbox implements a wide range of variants and analysis methods.

* Feedback Matrix designs, scalar, delay, and filter matrices
* Absorption filter design
* Time-varying matrix design
* Modal decomposition for spectral analysis
* FDN representations such as delay state space, state space, rational polynomials  

A wide range of applications is demonstrated in the example folders.
