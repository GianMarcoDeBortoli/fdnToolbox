# FDNTB: The Feedback Delay Network Toolbox
Matlab Toolbox for Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs). The accompanying paper is

*Sebastian J. Schlecht, "FDNTB: The Feedback Delay Network Toolbox", DAFx 2020, Vienna, Austria.*

If you use this toolbox for your research, please cite the accompanying paper.

Feedback delay networks (FDNs) are recursive filters, which are widely used for artificial reverberation and decorrelation. This toolbox implements a wide range of variants and analysis methods.

* Feedback Matrix designs, scalar, delay, and filter matrices
* Absorption filter design
* Time-varying matrix design
* Modal decomposition for spectral analysis
* FDN representations such as delay state space, state space, rational polynomials  

A wide range of applications is demonstrated in the example folders.
